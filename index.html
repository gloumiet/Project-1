       <p>Coffee’s story starts in Ethiopia, where legend says a goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats getting unusually energetic after eating red coffee cherries. By the 15th century, coffee was being cultivated and brewed in the Arabian Peninsula, especially in Yemen, where it became central to social life and religious practice. Coffeehouses, known as qahveh khaneh, spread through the Middle East, serving as hubs for conversation, music, and politics. From there, coffee traveled to Europe in the 17th century, sparking both controversy and obsession, and eventually to the Americas, where large-scale plantations were established. Today, coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, deeply tied to global trade, culture, and daily rituals.</p>

      <h1>Coffee</h1>
      <h2-word>The Heart of Your Cup</h2-word>
      <p>Coffee is the base of the drink and sets the overall flavor. The taste depends on the type of bean, roast level, and brewing method. Light roasts are brighter and more acidic, medium roasts are balanced, and dark roasts are bold and rich. Freshly brewed coffee or espresso gives the best flavor and aroma.</p>

    <div class="word container">
      <h1>Milk</h1>
      <h2-word>Creamy Goodness</h2-word>
      <p>Milk adds creaminess and softens the bitterness of coffee. Whole milk makes drinks rich and smooth, while low-fat milk is lighter. Plant-based options like oat, almond, or soy milk each add their own flavor, oat milk is especially popular for its creamy texture and ability to foam well.</p>

    <div class="word container">
      <h1>Toppings</h1>
      <h2-word>Flavor Your Way</h2-word>
      <p>Toppings and add-ins customize the drink and add sweetness or extra flavor. Common options include flavored syrups like vanilla or caramel, sugar or honey, spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg, chocolate drizzle, or whipped cream. These extras turn a basic coffee into a personalized drink.</p>
